# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to create a vacation planning beta app that uses OpenWeatherMap's API and Google's Map API to retrieve important weather information in cities of interest. First, 2,000 random latitude and longitude coordinates are generated and then the nearest cities to those coordinates are pulled. Using OpenWeatherMap's API, the coordinates for those cities is retrieved along with the maximum temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, wind speed, adn the weather description. A dataframe depicting this information was created for easier readibility. Next, input statements were created to prompt the user to enter in their temperature preferences for their ideal vacation location. Once a numeric temperature input is given, the dataframe was filtered to reflect only generated cities that matched the given temperature preferences. All rows that contained empty values were dropped. A new dataframe was created to add a column showing nearby hotel names after conducting a hotel search. A for loop was used to find the nearest hotel for each city. If a hotel was unable to be found, then it was skipped and the loop continued. Next, using Google's Map API, an interactive map figure was created with marker indicators to show locations of the hotels in each city along with all other previous information, including the hotel name, city name, country code, and a brief weather description. This will be displayed in a pop-up fashion for each marker that is clicked.
